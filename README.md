## Simple Unity Object History

This is a very simple Object History Window for Unity. The window records previously selected objects, which can be used for quick access.

### Installation and Usage

Simply grab the script in the `Editor` folder, and place it in any folder in the Editor assembly in Unity (e.g. a folder named `Editor`).
In Unity, open the window at: **Window > General > Simple Object History**.

How to use:
1. The Object History Window only starts recording items after it has been opened.
2. When a selection of a Unity Object (Folders, ScriptableObject, GameObject etc) has been performed, it will be recorded into the Window.
3. Click on the object entry in the window to highlight the previous selected Object, or Double Click on the object entry to open it.
